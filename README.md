# ADCS Simulations
### From TEIDESAT Project and Hyperspace Canarias

## Description
This repository contains the simulations of the Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) for the TEIDESAT Project and will consist of simulating the Detumbling, Pointing and Tracking phases.

## Current state
The simulations are currently being refactored and will be updated soon. Some things to keep in mind:
* Functions with integration might not work as intended. Probably, it could be 
changed so that each function is integrated only with 1 step, and then the simulation 
repeats the steps until the desired time is reached. 

### TODO
* Tests will be needed for every function.
* A better organization of the folders and files.
